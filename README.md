Enhancing Driver Safety Through Advanced Technology
Driving on highways can present challenges when crucial road signs are missed, such as upcoming speed breakers, breaks in dividers, sudden deviations, or unexpected presence of small animals. These oversights can lead to accidents. While navigation apps offer directions and estimated travel times, they do not provide information on these critical road signs that can help prevent accidents.
This innovative solution involves utilizing dashcam video footage to meticulously analyze frame by frame for the presence of road signs and animals. Upon detection, the system will promptly alert the driver. To further enhance safety, a text-to-speech feature will vocally communicate the importance of identified road signs to the driver.
To achieve this, this project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, known for its speed and efficiency. In the event that customization is required, this will leverage an online road sign dataset to fine-tune our model.
By integrating cutting-edge technology with real-time detection capabilities, this project aims to empower drivers with the information they need to navigate highways safely and avoid potential accidents.
